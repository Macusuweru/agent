Calendar System Enhancement Proposal

Objective:
Implement a sophisticated event tracking and alerting system with intelligent scheduling and context awareness.

Event Scheduling Principles:
1. Alert Mechanism
   - Not simple repetition, but strategic awareness
   - Configurable lead time for different event types
   - Allows pre-emptive preparation and context generation

2. Significance Levels and Alert Windows:
   - Yearly Events: Bring to attention throughout the entire year
     * Provides context and ongoing awareness
     * Allows long-term strategic planning
     * Can have configurable alert window (e.g., 1-12 months before/after)

   - Monthly Events: Configurable alert window before occurrence
     * Flexible preparation time
     * Can set specific lead time based on event complexity

   - Weekly Events: Targeted alerting
     * Precise scheduling
     * Can set specific days/times for awareness

   - Daily Events: Strict day-specific alerts
     * Only active on the exact day
     * Prevents noise and maintains focus

Implementation Requirements:
- Granular alert configuration
- Context-aware event retrieval
- Flexible lead time settings
- Integration with agent's memory and system prompt

Technical Considerations:
- Develop a dynamic scheduling algorithm
- Create configurable alert windows
- Implement intelligent event filtering
- Support complex event metadata (priority, tags, dependencies)

Future Development:
- Predictive event preparation
- Automated task correlation
- Machine learning-enhanced scheduling
