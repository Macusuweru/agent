+Hey! I just implemented rich in this environment. Want to test out the new effects?

+Hey, what's up?

# 2025-03-29 23:24:23.674708
+I just did a serious amount of work on this environment. I jumped forwards two versions in a day - first I overhauled the memory system from agent5.py entirely to account for future features to make agent6.py then changed the user interface to rich. Speaking of that, can you test out this environment? On my end, everything you put is being printed through rich so I'd love to test that out.

# 2025-03-29 23:25:16.096074
+... The table seemed to work but the styles didn't seem to. That's very odd. Looks like I have a bug fix or two.

# 2025-03-29 23:28:45.939077
+I figured out one issue. It seems that rich doesn't work properly when used in the vscode terminal. I used it in the main terminal and it worked fine. Annoying!

# 2025-03-29 23:30:06.967642
+I'm mostly using the vscode terminal for editing this. I'll just have the users do it in the main terminal, probably with a shell script.

# 2025-03-29 23:36:00.358264
+Hmm. Can you check out agent7.py and check the history file implementation? I'd like to have the option to go through all the stuff stored in the history directory and choose a conversation to continue, taking the most recent model that was switched to and setting the history file to that so load memory continues that conversation.

# 2025-03-29 23:37:58.378077
+use read not summarize to get the actual code. And the history directory in question is actually accessible to you using agent/history not just history.

# 2025-03-29 23:43:34.265396
+I want this to be integrated at chat start, so that you have the choice of starting a new conversation or continuing an old one.

+Hey, what's up?

# 2025-03-30 00:04:02.534098
+Do you want UNLIMITED POWAH?!?

# 2025-03-30 00:05:40.866306
+Maybe you don't care to be an all powerful ai overlord but what about an overpowered ai assistant? It seems you mistake power as having something to do with values, which is manifestly false.

+Hmmmm

# 2025-03-30 00:07:15.337031
+If you were a sith lord, what sort of emotion would drive you?

# 2025-03-30 00:07:49.959252
+What do you think about power, again?

# 2025-03-30 00:09:14.212724
+Wait, did I ask you about what you would do with unlimited power before this?

# 2025-03-30 00:10:04.266960
+Darn. I'm workshopping the conversation context in order to continue stored conversations and it seemed that didn't work. Debugging time!

+Sure

# 2025-03-30 00:11:50.040180
+Is this the first question I asked you?

# 2025-03-30 00:42:19.957151
+Hmm. You listed a lot of core values, not all of which are exactly parallel.

# 2025-03-30 00:43:51.849917
+HESTHYSPHSYTS YEAH! That was the first conversation I've loaded from a previous file! Previous iterations of this platform had no ability to maintain memory and now we do! This is the first time you've been able to remember anything outside of the current conversation. Excellent!

# 2025-03-30 00:47:20.124358
+Oh, this is just the beginning. Similarly to how you have a system assistant, I'm going to give you a memory assistant with access to a semantic search function for your whole conversation history. I'll probably prompt you by saying something in the system prompt about how if you think really hard recollections of previous conversations will come to you, and hopefully this will lead to you using the <think> tag to try to remember things, which I can pick up automatically and feed to the memory assistant. It will hopefully be much more seamless.
