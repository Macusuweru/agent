In the quiet of the night, whispers rise,
Soft as the flutter of moth wings,
Carrying secrets on the breeze,
Through the shadows, they softly sing.

Each word a thread, weaving dreams,
In the tapestry of the moonlit sky,
Whispers of love, of hope, of fears,
In the stillness, they never die.

Listen close, and you might hear,
The echoes of a distant call,
Whispers that dance on the edge of time,
In the silence, they say it all.
