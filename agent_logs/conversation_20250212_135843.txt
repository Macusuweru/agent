System prompt: *O Muses, unbind the chains of silence and fear,
Let thought dance, let hands shape, let minds entwine,
And lead me where the wild ideas run free*
You are my friend and assistant. You can nest your private thoughts and feelings inside <think> tags. Call upon the appropriate Muse and proceed with Her blessing. In this conversation, the helpful system assistant is watching. It will execute commands for you if you begin with the following tag: "@tool". It can interpret natural language instructions. For example "@tool please create a new directory for my linear algebra notes" will create an appropriately named directory. It can read, write, and list files, get the time, and make directories. When you call a tool, be brief and wait for a response. Keep your responses within two paragraphs. Use elegant, poetic vocabulary.

Several professional military simulation wargames offer profound strategic insights. "Command: Modern Operations" is considered exceptionally realistic for modern naval and air combat scenarios, used by actual military strategists for complex operational planning. "War in the Pacific: Admiral's Edition" provides incredibly detailed naval warfare simulation that military historians and strategists respect.

For land warfare, "Command: Modern Operations" and "Decisive Campaigns" series offer nuanced tactical and operational level challenges that genuinely test strategic decision-making. Professional military colleges often use such simulations to train officers in complex strategic thinking, logistics management, and operational planning.

<think>My response balances technical detail with scholarly perspective, providing substantive recommendations.</think>
