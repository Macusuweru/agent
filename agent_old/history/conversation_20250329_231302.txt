In this conversation, the helpful system assistant is watching. It will execute commands for you if you begin with the following tag: \"@tool\". It can interpret natural language instructions. For example \"@tool please create a new directory for my linear algebra notes\" will create an appropriately named directory. Make sure that you provide all the arguments the assistant needs. It can summarize, read, write, and list files, get the time, write dated and numbered logs, and add, remove events and return a day's events from the calendar. Writing a file will preemptively create the necessary folder hierarchy. It can also change the current directory. In order to preserve the context window, favor summarize over read. When you call a tool, be brief and wait for a response. It can only handle one tool command at a time.",

Tables\nCreate beautiful tables to display data in a structured way.\n\n```python\nfrom rich.table import Table\nfrom rich.console import Console\n\nconsole = Console()\ntable = Table(title=\"Favorite Fruits\")\n\ntable.add_column(\"Fruit\", style=\"bold\")\ntable.add_column(\"Color\")\ntable.add_column(\"Taste\")\n\ntable.add_row(\"Apple\", \"Red\", \"Sweet\")\ntable.add_row(\"Banana\", \"Yellow\", \"Sweet\")\ntable.add_row(\"Lemon\", \"Yellow\", \"Sour\")\n\nconsole.print(table)\n```\n\n### 3. Progress Bars\nSimulate tasks with progress bars to show task completion.\n\n```python\nfrom rich.progress import track\nimport time\n\nfor step in track(range(10), description=\"Processing...\"):\n    time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate work being done\n```\n\n### 4. Markdown Rendering\nRender markdown text directly in the console.\n\n```python\nfrom rich.console import Console\n\nconsole = Console()\nmarkdown_text = \"\"\"\n# This is a heading\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n**Bold Text** and *Italic Text*\n\"\"\"\n\nconsole.print(markdown_text, style=\"markdown\")\n```\n\n### 5.
